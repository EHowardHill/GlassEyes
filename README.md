**10 years ago**, Toby Fox released his biggest game, Undertale.

**10 years ago**, I released my oldest fantasy novel, "Glass Eyes".

**To celebrate both**, I am adapting my novel into a Gameboy Advance title, using the style of Undertale.

*Happy anniversary!*

##

An unlucky college student falls down a garbage chute into the scary world below, dominated by muetos - a wary and spiteful enemy of humanity. His only hope to return home is through an unlikely allyship with a friendly mueto, which throws him into a web of despair much larger than he could have ever imagined.
